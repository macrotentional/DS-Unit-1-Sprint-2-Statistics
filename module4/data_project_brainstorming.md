## Misconceptions

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Yes, there are many approaches to this topic.


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Yep

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

I could also look at digital wellness. However I'd like to stick to data associated with sleep

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

Could I use my own fitbit data?? How many people have uploaded their wearable data? Is there a public repository? Surely there are many studies that have investigated data related to sleep
